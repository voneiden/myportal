Last shift ahead at Nokia now. All this came bit suddenly, but guess I'm now bailing out from Salo to more greener lands. 5 months. 4-shift work has really put some pressure on my body. Constantly changing sleeping and eating rhythms, difficulties to find proper times and energy for exercising, these 5 months have definitely been rough. <p>
Time to move on.<p>
Updated the route plan a little. Cambodia and Laos have now been completely dropped off and I'm focusing more on Nepal. Current order of traveling through countries;<br>
<i><b>India</b> -> Thailand -> Malaysia -> Indonesia -> Malaysia -> Thailand -> India -> Nepal -> <b>India</b></i>
<p>
The length of the whole trip is still prone to change. Depends slightly on Mr. Sopuli, if he joins my route in March, I might consider staying a bit longer (and chilling slightly more, to save money).

Things are looking quite good.
