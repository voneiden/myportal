Just bought this couple years old kite model from eBay. The Blade is well known for it's massive lift and by such it has been named by the community as "The Widowmaker". Everywhere I look on Flexifoil forums, people keep writing things like "it's scary" and "not for people who know what fear is". Unfortunately the delivery will be late due to certain reasons, so I'm not going to be able to test it on the coming weekend. The wind conditions look good, and I think we'll go try around with the Hornets, skis and snowboards.
