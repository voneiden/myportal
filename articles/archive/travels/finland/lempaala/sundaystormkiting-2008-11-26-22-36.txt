It was quite a nice day. The wind was strong and gusty, though slightly less than in the forecast. I managed to get my hands on snowkiting. Gotta admit, the speeds are impressive, even with my 2m kite I could easily outrun anyone chasing me with proper wind conditions. We didn't have enough space though and not enough snow either, so it was quite difficult to avoid not being pushed too far downwind. I fell down tens of times and as of writing on Wednesday I still have some places sore. But yeah, fun for sure. Now I just need a bigger kite to try with more calm winds (and hopefully better upwind performance).
