Things are starting to look hazardous. Here's the WRF forecast for Sunday:<br>

The gust peaks are forecasted to peak at 17,1m/s. WHAT THE.. My Hornet 2.0's upper wind range is 30 knots, that's roughly 15,5m/s. I will assume these peaks will be weaker here, since the land is hilly and there's lots of forest, but still. I think this is going to be one freaking faceplant day. It's gonna snow more too. <p>
Yes!
