New colour on the site. Now it reminds me of mango ice cream. 9 days to go, not really feeling much at the moment. All there's to do is pretty much done. All of the arrangements have been done except baggage insurance. Need to renew my bank passwords, fill the notebook with crucial numbers and buy some of the basic hygiene things, like disinfectant for cleaning hands.

On the other decisions made, Blade is not joining this trip. As much fun as it might provide, it might prove dangerous too thus teaching complete beginners to fly it might be too hazardous. Also it takes twice the space as the Hornet. The new fancy backpack will stay home too. Instead I'll take an old backpack from 60s I randomly bought from an auction last summer. It's (seemingly) durable and the overall design is much more spacious.<p>
Yeah. Next generation hippie traveller incoming.
