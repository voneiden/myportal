The chaos is cooling down in Nepal, and the almost two-week-long national protests around are ceasing down after the police shot two people who were on a mob attacking police positions. The government freaked out and gave up and proclaimed the two rioters as martyrs and wopsaah, things are looking nice now.<p>
Thanks to this, hopefully the roads are now open again from angry mobs and I booked my ticket to Chitwan National Park. The joyful thing is that I'm supposed to be at the bus station by 6:30 in the morning. I do not own an alarm clock at the moment, so I'm curious to see how things turn out..<p>
In Chitwan I'll most likely catch the malaria just before I head back home or get eaten by a tiger.
