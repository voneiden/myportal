Yesterday was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holi">holi</a>day, a hindu festival of colours. Well, I got my fair share of it, don't really have any pictures, but still can't find a way to upload them so would it matter.<p>

My general impressions:<br>

Today I arrived into Kathmandu. The bus dropped me where it wasn't supposed to and I did not get woken up at 6 am as I requested, but nevertheless I ended up here in Thamel (without falling as taxifood).<br>
Sun is my compass.<br>
Tomorrow's gonna be a "tour all the crap tourists attractions" -day and after that I remain still undecided. There was some violence around Chitwan few days ago, I hear, but I still cannot confirm this from official news sources. Folks say a policeman got shot or something. *shrug*<p>
Feeling lazy to write, as usual.
