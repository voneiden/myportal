Oh the peace. Fresh air. Lack of traffic. No rickshaws, no tuktuks. Few touts selling marijuana, but that's about it. Breezy wind, cool air, warm sun, forest, a big lake, lots of food, cheap places to sleep. That's Pohkara.<p>
The way here was bit less, and the trip included a couple of scams and a blown tyre. But made it anyway. Now chilling for the next few days, trying to find folk interested into trekking to Jomsom's.<p>
