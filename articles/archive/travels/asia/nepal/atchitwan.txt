<i>Ayeeyah</i>, escaped the pollution of Kathmandu Valley finally, and arrived to Chitwan with no problems. A hotel tout got me this time, although I swore that I'd go for the cheapy places. Well, I got a bungalow sort of thingie with attached bathroom and mosquito net for Rs400 (be that 4 euros). Actually it's a double, but what can ya do. Managed to haggle the price down from Rs600, which is quite reasonable in the end I think.<p>
This town, Sauraha, is pretty much a tourist town. 90% of the buildings are hotels, resorts, guest houses, souvenir shops, restaurants or general shops. In the end, there are surprisingly few tourists around, possibly thanks to the protests that raved around. So it's quiet. Extremely clean, except for the elephant <i>dung</i>, but even that gets cleaned and washed daily off the streets. Honking is banned, so in general it's just the birds singing and mosquitoes iiiiiining. There's more traffic pulled/carried by elephants, horses and camels than there are cars around here. Simply calm. Relaxing. Perfect after the dizzying chaos of Kathmandu.<p>
I wouldn't mind staying a week here.. And I'll consider it.<p>
Didn't remember elephants were that huge. o.o
