Nothing special going on here, on my part. Finished reading Noble House and found it quite fascinating. Already got a new book, Tolkien's Unfinished Tales which seems to be rather heavy reading. There's a jolly fine new strike here in Nepal, and currently public transport out of Chitwan is dead.. I'm carefully rethinking if I dare to leave here as late as on Monday.. should there be new strikes (or should this one continue indefinably.
<p>
There is also the question how to cover the vast distance from Sunauli to Delhi. Either a direct bus (24 hours min).. or a bus to Gorakhpur and somehow fighting one's way on a train. There's exactly one train with free beds .. on AC2 (the second most expensive). Argh. I think I'll be adventurous and try the 24h bus ride (+1 flat tire, +1 blown engine = 34 hours)

Gods, my ass will be sore.
