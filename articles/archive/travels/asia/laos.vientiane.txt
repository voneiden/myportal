And here I be, in Laos. The capital of Laos. This place just seems like a small town. Very relaxed. Calm. French influence in buildings & food. The palace was a joke. And so on.<p>

To enlighten the situation slightly more, I'll simply let you folks know that I've been walking a lot lately and been sleeping even less. My lower back is sort of bleeding thanks to the heavy backpack (I'd really like to dump all the extra stuff I'm carrying right now). So, right now, even though I should possibly write here something I think I prefer to go to sleep.<p>

Stay tuned for more of The Peoples Democratic Rebublic, Laos PDR, or also often written as, Laos, Please Don't Rush.
