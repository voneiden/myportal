Just arrived tonight after an amazing (mini)bus ride through the great mountains of Northern Laos. On the way I spent one night in the "backpacker" hotspot Vang Vien. <p>
The definition of modern backpacker can be rather twisted. Imagine a drunk British person, smoking opium while sitting in a restaurant staring 24/7 at the tv show Friends. Alternative possibilities include simply being drunk without being stoned, or watching to Family Guy or Simpsons. Tens of restaurants are blasting these tv series non stop day and night. <p>
I didn't really do anything in Vang Vien. I'll stop there again on the way back south, to possibly do some kayaking or just bicycle my way around. It's really like Laos version of Khao San. I hate it, but the scenery is very pretty. <p>
The internet access in there is also one of the most expensives I've seen. 300k/minute. I shared a room with a south african half german dude, named Gieter. The accommodation here is just simply too expensive, considering my budget. Tonight I had no choice but to get a bed from place costing me 70000k, that be roughly 7 euros.<p>
The ride from Vang Vien to Luan Prabang was stunning. Absolutely huge mountains covered with thick forest. On the way we also saw quite a few accidents, as the roads are narrow and people are doing crazy overtakes in blind corners. One of the accident scenes included 3 big trucks. I'd much prefer to use the slowest method of moving when going back south, a local bus. It's slow, but in the mountains slow means obviously safe.<p>
<b>Big Brother</b>, Lisaa kuvia tulee kun loydan koneen jossa on SD kortin lukija. Olen edelleenkin liikkeessa ilman usb johtoa kameraan. Sijoitin jo huomattavan summan uuteen kannykkalaturiin (4 euroa), usb johtoa voidaan katsella sitten ens kuussa.
<p>
<b>Leenalle</b> kiitokset aktiivisesta seuraamisesta. Meinaako Pauli olla kanssa siella Phuketin lahella (eikos se Phuket nyt ollut?) kolmen viikon paasta?<p>
The plan for the rest of the route is still slightly open. After many times of changing the plans (Go cambodia no, go Laos no, go Malaysia no, go Burma yes, go Laos yes, go China no..) I'm thinking of again going back to India to recheck the situation. I sure got bad first impression but it can't be the whole truth. I think my main destination would be Nepal over India though. To achieve that, I'd need to go to Bangkok to arrange the flight date with Jetairways. And I don't even know if it's possible achieve. But for now, I'll continue here in Laos.<p>
