Last morning I just got the idea that I want to get rid of <a href="http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/">Pyblosxom</a> as the blog code. Why? Because I don't know how it works and find it difficult to modify. So I made my own blog cgi, dubbed RandomXom, in few hours. It looks almost the same plus it already has one major feature that Pyblosxom doesn't have: <a href="http://www.mattieiden.com/cgi-bin/blog.cgi/travels/7">viewing older posts</a>.<p>
Viewing individual posts and comments is not yet included. This might be more of a hassle anyway..

Update #1<br>
While Pybloxsom claims to be lightweight and simplistic, as with all long term projects features get added every now and then slowly turning the project into a little big monster.<p>

Update #2<br>
Comments are now working. There's a "show older" link at the bottom of listing pages. I'm spent. Bye bye pyblosxom.<br>
