<a href="http://www.gog.com/en/frontpage">GOG</a> just got a brand new website! For a while it seemed as the site was going to be down and never be back, but surprise surprise, a comeback they made. Tons of neat games with ridiculous prices. I just bought <a href="http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/ground_control_expansion">Ground Control + Expansion</a> for some 4 euros 50 cents.<br>

The download speed from the site seemed pretty okay, some 350kb/s. The games are DRM free, and no extra download managers or launchers are required. Neat!
