Being a big fan of space (simulation) stuff, especially a game like <a href="http://rise.unistellar.com/">Rise: The Vieneo Province</a>, I stumbled upon a neat game that nears completion called <a href="http://www.minerwars.com/?aid=852">Miner Wars</a>. It features some newtonian physics space flying, shooting, mining and totally destructible environment. I've never paid for an online game, but I guess this might be the first.
