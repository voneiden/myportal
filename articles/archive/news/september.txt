Nothing much new on the personal side of my life, getting myself adjusted to being a student again. The blog got new colours resembling autumn (which don't look that great but I'm lazy to fine tune) and the picture gallery code is still work in progress. I should try to find inspiration for it at some point I guess.
<br>
Usually I got my hands full on something else though, a couple of books I'm trying to work through; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Limits">Beyond the Limits</a> and learning some &#54620;&#44397;&#50612;. On the school side there's not much work to do. I should write a report on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose">cellulose</a> decomposition. Suppose I'm gonna work on that one tomorrow.
<br>
What can I say, life feels good.
<br>
If you got spare time, check out Fault Line's short documentary on the situation of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwOKwuuveSQ&feature=related">the mentally ill in the US prison systems</a>. It got aired by Al Jazeera, the voice of the unheard. Yeah, I'm still a big fan of theirs. They don't air crap.

By the way, it's quite interesting to check out the "rejected comments" file set the spam filter to create. Currently there are 185 comments that got classified as spam. Zero comments after my trip that didn't. Screw you internet. Here follows my favourites!<br>
1) Swine flu vaccine advertisiment. "<i>we have the best fle vaccine</i>"<br>
2) MMORPG related advertisiments. WoW gold, MapleStory..<br>
3) <i>los angeles male strippers</i><br>
4) "<i>...substantially anything scarcely you regardless of the make or the CEO is a pedophile.</i>" wait what is this I don't even<p>
