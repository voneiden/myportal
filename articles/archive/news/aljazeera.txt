For reliable and neutral point of view on global news, I can warmly recommend <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net">Al Jazeera</a>. During the last year I've found this source to be excellent place for up to date events and happenings around the world with minimal amount of exaggerating and false news. They don't post bullshit either and all the articles have a professional grip. Al Jazeera's <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/Services/Rss/?PostingId=2007731105943979989">RSS feed</a> is clean and short (unlike at BBC). They also write on matters of which the western media is not concerned..

I really think Firefox should dump BBC as it's default news feed.
