The pedals came off finally! It took a long time, and I finally made it with the help of a vice bench, a huge adjustable wrench and some trimming of the pedal axle with an angle grinder. Boiling water method did not help at all, neither did drilling.<p>
I'm now in the process of grinding the old paint away and preparing to paint the frame. I also need new pedals, and I thought to grab Onza double caged.<br>
