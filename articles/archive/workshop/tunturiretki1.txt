So I grabbed a bunch of bicycles from Ritakatu as the janitor was going to throw them away, one of them was a oldie touring bicycle Tunturi Retki Super from the 1980s. Originally it had 12 gears, however the d√©railleur had been blasted to oblivion by the previous owner, so the gears were totally useless. I stripped the bicycle down to the frame, after I had tested I could use a 20t old bicycle rear hub, if I switched the bigger 50t chainring on the other side. This gives me a neat 50:20 (2.6) single speed bike. <br>

The bike above is the same model as mine, except in better condition. Right now I'm in the process of grinding the frame from rust, old paint, decals, and excess welded metal parts. The frame will get a nice color of metallic blue. The pedals are still stuck in the cranks, I need a lot of heat to remove them, I guess. More precise specification and pictures will follow. Here's a decal I made for the new one; <br>
