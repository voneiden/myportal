"Being a largely rural economy most of our waste used to be bio-degradable," 
said Prashant Pastore, an expert on waste management at Toxics Link, an 
environmental advocacy organisation based in New Delhi, "The problem is our 
consumption habits have changed but our dumping habits have not."

"We've had lots of infant death and there is a high incidence of respiratory 
infections," said Doctor Neelam Rane, head of the Deonar local residents' group 
that is trying to get the dumps closed down.

Most Indian cities have no formal system of collection for household waste, 
and rely instead on low-caste scavengers or ragpickers who sift though the
rubbish in search of items and materials of value. Outside of India's big 
cities, rubbish is simply dumped on vacant plots or in nearby fields or 
forests. Authorities in Mumbai have begun spraying the city's two biggest 
rubbish dumps with perfume to lessen the increasingly foul smell.
