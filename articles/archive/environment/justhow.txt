An interesting article about Co2 emissions, China and world on the subject <a href="http://www.grinzo.com/energy/index.php/2009/08/17/china-emissions-to-peak-in-2030/">"China emissions to peak in 2030"</a>.
<p>
So.. 25% increase in global Co2 emissions within the last 9 years. Are we really going to turn back? Ha-ha.
