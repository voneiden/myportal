<p>

We're now living the 21st century where there is one dictator above else, and that is the global media. Media controls, or at least leads, the truth, which in it's behalf controls how people act and react. The basic idea in effective communications is to affect the receivers emotions. For example, in humane catastrophes the media might try to appeal on the receivers compassion, to raise funds for support organizations, as happened very well with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Nargis">cyclone Nargis</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake">the Indian Ocean earthquake</a> in 2004.<p>

Basic human <a href="http://www.personalityresearch.org/basicemotions.html">emotions</a> can be divided within 4-9 emotions depending on the analysis. For the sake of simplicity I will take the one by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James">William James</a> (published 1884) which lists 4 basic emotions: Fear, grief, love and rage.<p>


<ul>
<li><b>Rage</b> - This approach requires the media to provoke it's receivers, often with exaggarated accusations. Anger is considered to be an effective weapon when you want quickly the support of public for actions that would be otherwise considered morally wrong. "Blind rage". An example of this would be the World Trade Center <strike>demolishments</strike> attacks which instantly sparked violence against American Middle-Eastern immigrants and eventually led to the destruction of Iraq, a country that wasn't even related to the original case.</li>
<li><b>Love</b> - Perhaps the least efficient and hardest to achieve in effective numbers. Used to remove negative attitude. Hippies tried hard "make love not war", but perhaps <a href="http://pw20c.mcmaster.ca/files/pw20c_images/00001675.jpg">used equally much by the military.</a> Especially in North Korea where the love propaganda of Kim Jong-Il has raised him on God-like levels.</li>
<li><b>Grief</b> - Above humane disaster examples</li>
<li><b>Fear</b> - The favourite weapon of modern media, originating from the United States of America. We have megatsunamis, killer bees, supervolcanoes, black presidents against freedom, deadly swine flu..</li>
</ul> 
<p>
Before we continue, watch this 1976 commercial about the Swine Flu pandemic that never happened. The vaccine actually killed 25 people.<br>

Okay, so if you're now thinking, "<i>Yeah yeah, I've heard this before, fear is used to influence us every day. So? What can I do about it? It's not like I can turn off my TV.</i>" -Actually yes, you can turn off your TV. You should be critical of what news you consider reliable and where you take your input. Fox News is not a good idea - after all they claimed in 2006 that <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,181513,00.html">trees are the cause of global warming</a>. A fine example of what media can cause with biased or "ill intentions" funded researches. It was <a href="http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2007/April/27040702.asp">proved nonsense</a> in 2007 by Danish researchers.<p>

<a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/index.html">WHO raised it's H1N1 alert level to a pandemic</a> a few days back. The pharmaceutical industry was cheering. The media's made a good job convincing us that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H1N1">2009 strain of H1N1</a> is <a href="http://article.wn.com/view/2009/04/26/Killer_flu_could_spark_global_epidemic/">deadly as hell</a>, dubbed as "Killer flu". But how deadly is it actually?<br>

According to the above facts, if Mexico (and the US) is excluded due to it's unbalancing nature, the 2009 "Swine flu" is only 0,02% percentage points more deadly than ordinary seasonal flu. Why is the 2009 H1N1 dubbed as a "Killer flu" by the media then? The answer seems to be rather simple. Deadly disease needs a lot of medicine, and pharmaceutical industry needs to bail out of regression. A Japanese company, <a href="http://www.chugai-pharm.co.jp/hc/chugai_top_en.jsp">Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd</a> <a href="http://209.85.129.132/search?q=cache:Nlr_LvcsMroJ:www.chugai-pharm.co.jp/pdf/annual_report/2009/eAR2009_12_04.pdf+http://www.chugai-pharm.co.jp/pdf/annual_report/2009/eAR2009_12_04.pdf"> predicted</a> a <b>531%</b> increase in Tamiflu profits in 2009. Tamiflu is the biggest vaccine seller against the H1N1 2009 strain and also numerous previous influenza viruses.<p>

Even though I don't really approve the huge profit-making of these medical industries (originally medicine was developed to help humans, not to rip their money off), I would at least assume that you get something of value for your money when you buy a tamiflu shot. <b>But you don't.</b> Tamiflu was found to be <a href="http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,28383,25138931-5007185,00.html">inefficient</a> against 2009 strain of H1N1. It's not even the first time; in the peak of 2002 H5N1 avian flu Tamiflu sales peaked also, even though yet again it was found out <a href="http://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/review.php?rid=27">simply useless against the strain</a>.<p>

This raises a serious question, if <b>Tamiflu is useless</b>, what keeps people and countries buying it? The answer is again somewhat simple. CDC, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention">Centers for Disease Control</a> (and Prevention) recommends it. CDC is a US government health organization and it also has an serious effect on 'overseas' health organizations. Who controls the CDC and why does Tamiflu keep making huge profits for selling a drug that <a href="http://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/review.php?rid=27">doesn't work</a>, <a href="http://www.psandman.com/col/tamiflu.htm">expires quickly</a> and <b>is actually made out of a common herb, </b>the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_anise">Star anise</a></i>?<p>

I will not touch this <strike>truth</strike> conspiracy theory as some people might get provoked by such nonsense. I mean, <i>few people trying to exploit a mass of people with medical business in a capitalistic world?</i>. Come on! That's just a silly idea. No.. wait.. shit.
