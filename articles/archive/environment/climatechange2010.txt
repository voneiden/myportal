After the Copenhagen conference did not succeed at forging the deal and after the <i>ICCP conspiracy</i> was revealed the opinion of the general public has seemed to shift in a negative way considering the perspective of our home planet. It's no surprise, of course, that attitudes of people are veryvery easy to shift. We're living in a world where media controls the public opinion, after all. <p>
Another thing seems to be, that our current winter's been cold all over the world. It's amazing that people forget all during one winter. The thing worth noting is, is that climate change is a phenomenon that occurs during a long time.  What happens during a year, or two years, or even ten years may not have anything to do with the climate change. To observe the phenomenon a long time span should be used, most commonly at least 50 years.<p>

We already know that the impact of climate change is the greatest at our poles and northern regions (when it comes to rising <i>mean</i> temperatures). This page is nice evidence of what is going on for example in Alaska. And it's ICCP independent so people who feel that ICCP (and United Nations) is a big scare might be able to examine the data: <a href="http://climate.gi.alaska.edu/ClimTrends/Change/TempChange.html">Alaska Climate Research Center</a><br>

(10F ~ 5,5C)<p>
<a href="http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/faq.html#9">artic.noaa.gov: 9. Are conditions in the Arctic the same today as they were 100 years ago?</a><p>

In the following article (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6145KP20100206">Arctic climate changing faster than expected</a>) one comment caught my eye:
<tt>This article is alarmist nonsense.

To see what is REALLY happening in the Arctic look here:

http://www.ijis.iarc.uaf.edu/en/home/seaice_extent.htm

Satellites don't lie and they show that Arctic sea ice has been INCREASING every year since the 2007 minimum to where it is now reaching a 30 year norm.

Antarctic ice is at a 30 year maximum.</tt><br>
The data from this Japanese university is quite reliable. They admit a possible error of 10%. The graph on the page gives indeed the idea that ice cover is rising. However further digging reveals..<br>

Long time trend of the ice sheet is clearly dropping. Fast. Even if for the last few years it's been going up again, this does by no means imply recovery. And it's far from the "30 year norm" this user claimed without no references. His other claim of Antarctic ice being at a 30 year maximum makes a little sense until we dig out from <a href="http://nsidc.org/sotc/sea_ice.html">NSIDC's page</a> :<br>

The above page provides interesting conclusions why this is happening and it is actually a very good proof of man introduced climate change.<p>

Change is certainly happening - we already know that first time in mankind's history normal cargo ships have now crossed the artic ocean (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE59S3LT20091029">Multiyear Arctic ice is effectively gone</a>).<p>
I've never liked the term global warming. That may be an ICCP term. But climate change has always existed and will always be existing. Whether humans are making a big impact on it or not. We know that our climate is the result of life. It's a big symbiosis, ever since the first bacteria plagued the oceans. Remember that life started with an atmosphere that could not sustain life.
