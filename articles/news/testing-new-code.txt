Once again this place is under rewriting. The last rewrite never finished properly. Will this one do? The CSS on this page ended up to rely heavily on CSS3, so a new browser is needed for the page to even display remotely OK. Rounded borders are a good example!

In the end, this layout looks pretty much like the old one, however I'm now considering a static page system over dynamic, but lets see about that. This page is now static, but generated by a script, of course.

The content management system took a spin into more complex direction too. Originally posts on this site were stored as plain text files, the first line of the text file being the header and all the rest being the content. The date was retrieved from the file timestamp, same style as in <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">blosxom</a>.<p>

This, however, caused some trouble for me. Conserving the timestamps became a bit of a burden, and accidentally modifying them was way too easy. Also I thought about using git to backup my posts, but git drops the timestamps altogether. The logical choice for me was to stick in the text based content management, but to include dates and such in the file text itself. Then I came up with using a very common standard - email plain text messages!<p>

Indeed, this file now looks roughly like this:<br>
<div id="code">
